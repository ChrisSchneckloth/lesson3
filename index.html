        <h2>Frontend Developer  </h2>

        <p>I am a sophmore at Wake Tech Community College, and I am currently majoring in Web & UX Design. My main goal when I am out of school is to land a job as a frontend developer. </p>
        <p>I have taken some classes already and feel confident as to where I am currently, but I know that I have a lot to learn before I could reach my goal, which would to be have my own firm, or company, that will specialize in designing clients webistes.
          One of the main reasons that I want this kind of job, not only because I enjoy it, but also, the flexability these kind of jobs offer is amazing, as I have the potential to work remote.
          I would love to work remotely and travel the world while I do it.

      <section>
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>I currently do not have any work experience with an actual programming company or role, but some of my previous jobs I have had throughout school I believe could 
          be useful in ways that coding does not necessarily come into play.

          <h3>Barista</h3>
          <h4>Starbucks</h4>
          <h4>9/20/2019 - 1/18/2020</h4>
          <p>Though this job may not seem to directly corellate, I was constantly working with customers and taking orders and remembering the regulars
            and staying engaged. As a frontend developer, I will meet with clients and have to be able to communicate well in order to understand exactly 
            what it is that they are looking for, and being able to remember all of your clients and keep that genuine relationship is just as important.
